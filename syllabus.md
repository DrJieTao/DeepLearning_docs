## Deliverables

__NOTE:__ All submissions should be in __Jupyter Notebooks__.

__NOTE:__ Please check each week's schedule/checklist frequently for important dates and other information.

### Coding Assignments

There are __four (4)__ coding assignments in this course, which covers different phases/aspects of a deep learning project. These are designed to provide you with an opportunity to internalize as well as apply the materials discussed during the class ses-sion and related practices.

These assignments will be made available along this course, please pay attention to each week's schedule/checklist.

It is expected that you __collaborate__ with your peers - but you still need to put in your best effort in the mini projects.

For each part, I have provided a __checkpoint opportunity__ for you so I can check on your work and provide feedback – you can submit your draft to me via email. I will __NOT__ grade on your draft work. The checkpoint is the _Saturday_ of the same week the respective part is released.


Completed notebooks should be submitted to your Google Classroom. __No email submission will be accepted.__

### Course Project

The course project is the comprehensive assessment of this course. The project is supposed to be a deep learning “code portfolio” that they can show future employers
to demonstrate their proficiency. Each portfolio should consist of one or more Jupyter notebooks
posted on __Colab__, and should focus on analyzing a particular set of data to uncover business insights. Students are encouraged to find their own datasets rather than using
those from in-class activities. There are __four__ deliverables for the final project:
+ _Proposal (10%)_: a Jupyter notebook describing the dataset, basic descriptive features of the
data, and a plan for more in-depth analysis. The notebook should clearly describe the purpose,
methodology, and anticipated result of the analysis to a non-technical business audience.
+ _Milestone Report (10%)_: report the progress of the project.
+ _Final deliverable and presentation (10% each)_: the completed portfolio, composed of one or more Jupyter
notebooks. They should be written with a target audience of a manager in a relevant company 
and should be written with clear descriptions and explanations that are understandable to a
non-technical audience.

With the submission of the final deliverable, each individual will complete a survey describing his or
her own contribution to the project, as well as a breakdown of the percentage of total work performed
by each person in the team. The breakdown must add up to 100% and must include yourself. This
will be used to adjust individual grades if certain members contributed little. Detailed instructions and
grading rubric for each deliverable will be posted before they are due. 

### Participation and Professionalism
Given the large class enrollment and the technical nature of the subject, it is critical that everyone take a professional approach to learning the material. Students are expected to come to class prepared and then participate in all activities to the best of their abilities. Cheating, free-riding, and other unprofessional behavior will not be tolerated.

## Course Policies
__Special Note for the Online Section__: the online section will be asynchronous - meaning __no__ class meetings. You are expected to follow the _flipped classroom_ model (described below). And if you need help for course work (e.g. exercises, Q&As, group work), contact Ms. Yue (for technical support of Colab/Slack), your Python tutors (for course related questions), or myself for assistance.

__Flipped Classroom__: This course, including both the in-person and the online sections, will follow a _flipped classroom_ manner. Which means the lectures (e.g. in _recorded videos_) will be released to you __prior__ to every schedule class meeting. It is __mandatory__ for you to watch the class videos prior to the class meetings. The actual class meeting will be mainly for course work (e.g. exercises, Q&As, group work). In order for this model to work, it is crucial for you to come in __prepared__. Refer to the __preparations__ item for more details.

__Note Taking__: While you are watching the class lectures, make sure you take notes. A separate presentation file will be provided to you via _Google Classroom_ for you to take notes. In most of the lecture notebooks, there are some exercise questions. You will need to submit exercise files after most of the classes. We will use a _buddy system_ in which students form 2-3 people groups for comparing notes and codes.

__Preparations__: To contribute to class discussions, you must spend adequate time prior to class preparing carefully all required tasks (e.g., readings, assignments). This is __mandatory__!

__Respect and Dignity__: It is also important for each of us as individuals to respect each other. Treat your classmates with respect and dignity (I like to call this R&D). Listen carefully to the questions and comments while keeping an open mind for ideas. It is okay to disagree with certain viewpoints, but present your arguments in a courteous manner. Negative body la-guage such as rolling your eyes, using phrases such as “that was a dumb idea”, or interrupting others to express disagreements runs counter to the spirit of positive learning environment and is not okay. At the end of the day, we would like to create a positive environment that is conducive to learning.

__Professionalism__: As budding professionals and business majors, conduct yourself in a professional manner just as you would with an employer or colleague. Refrain for unprofessional behaviors such as arriving late to class, coming in and out of class, taking a nap in class, making unprofessional comments to other students and the instructor, and sending unprofessional comments. Out of respect for fellow students, all mobile communication and entertainment devices need to be turned off and kept off during the class. Only software tools required for the class (e.g. JupyterHub) or note taking software (e.g., Evernote) the class time.

## Other Course Policies

__Computer and Lab__: You will have to bring in a laptop for every class in order to complete the in-class tutorials. It is your responsibility to make sure that your laptop is up-to-date so that it runs the system smoothly. You will need to have access to a Jupyter environment to complete the course work - fail to do so will lead to failing the course.

__Course Materials__: All the teaching materials, including assignments and exams, are the intellectual properties of Fairfield University – distributing such materials without written approval is strongly prohibited.

__Late Submissions__: Grades become official one week after assignments/exams have been returned by the instructor. Late submissions might be accepted with a 10% grade penalty. Oral excuses are not acceptable. No make-up opportunities would be given to final deliverables of projects.

__Class Communications and Feedbacks__: We will use __Slack__ for __all__ course communications. __DO NOT SEND EMAIL TO YOUR PROFESSORS. DM instead.__ You will receive an email invitation from ``Yue.Pu@fairfield.edu`` with instructions. You need to join the ``#ISOM6900`` channel to communicate with me and the class. Normally, I would reply to your DM no longer than __12__ hours. Allow more time during weekends and holidays. Feedbacks on your assignments/deliverables will generally be returned to your within a week after the due of the assignment. After receiving the feedback (and grade), you have __three (3)__ days to dispute a grade with proper justified reasons. 

__Academic Honesty__: Fairfield University’s primary purpose is the pursuit of academic excellence. All members of the Fairfield University community share responsibility for establishing and maintaining appropriate standards of academic honesty and integrity. This is possible only in an atmosphere where discovery and communication of knowledge are marked by scrupulous, unqualified honesty. In the event of such dishonesty, professors are to award a grade of zero for the project, paper, or examination in question, and may record an F for the course itself.

__Students with Disabilities__: Fairfield University is committed to providing qualified students with disabilities an equal opportunity to access the benefits, rights and privileges of its services, programs and activities, in an accessible setting. Fur-thermore, in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Connecticut State laws, we provide reasonable accommodations to qualified students, to reduce the impact of disabilities on academic functioning or upon other major life activities. 

__Online Office/Coaching Hours__: online office hours are available via [Zoom](), which runs in addition to the regular on ground office hours. If needed, additional coaching hours can be arranged.
